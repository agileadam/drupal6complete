==============================================================================
OVERVIEW                                                *drupal6complete-intro*

The drupal6complete plugin will add omnicompletion for the Drupal 6 API 
through the use of auto-generated ctags. The plugin will only serve completion
matches for the Drupal 6 core. In the future, expect to see another plugin 
from me that will allow you to generate your own completion matches for 
contributed modules as well.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                   *drupal6complete-usage*

The following should be added to your .vimrc file to trigger the plugin:
>
    imap <buffer> <C-d> <C-\><C-O>:call drupal6complete#Map()<CR><C-X><C-O>
<
By default (shown above) you hit "Ctrl-d" to autocomplete. So, for example,
I can type "drupal_get_" followed by "Ctrl-d" and I'll be presented with any
matches.

The <C-d> can be changed to whatever trigger you would like. <C-C>d, for 
example, would trigger the completion on "Ctrl-c", immediately followed by 
hitting 'd'.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION           *drupal6complete-configuration* *drupal6complete-ctags*

This script doesn't require or offer too many configuration options (at the
time of writing).

Automatic Parenthesis~
Function suggestions can have a ( automatically applied by setting the
following variable in your .vimrc file: >
    let g:drupal6complete_add_paren = 1
<
Completion Results~
By default, omni completion doesn't show the menu if only one result is found.
The following setting will show the menu even when there is only one match: >
    set cot+=menuone
<
==============================================================================
SUPPORT                        *drupal6complete-support* *drupal6complete-help*

Please submit an issue if the plugin is missing a function or constant, or is
providing incorrect information about a function or constant.

==============================================================================
DEVELOPER INFORMATION                              *drupal6complete-developers*

The following information is for developers, and attempts to explain how the
datasource for the drupal6complete is created.

You will need a current version of Exuberant ctags to use all of the options 
required. You can obtain the latest version here: http://ctags.sourceforge.net

You can feed ctags specific files and directories, and it will automatically 
create a tags file. This file will require some cleanup before you can use
it for the plugin. You will want to run a command like below from the root of 
a Drupal installation. You can feed ctags more directories and files than
the ones in this example.

Simple example (Drupal core only) >
    ctags --php-kinds=-v --langmap=php:.module.inc -R 
    \ includes/* modules/* themes/engines/* 
<
Advanced example (Drupal core with a specific few modules) >
    ctags --php-kinds=-v --langmap=php:.module.inc -R 
    \ includes/* modules/* themes/engines/* sites/all/modules/views/*
    \ sites/all/themes/zen/*
<

After running the ctags command and checking the resulting file for 
double-quotes (and escaping them), these commands will 
clean up the tags, and put them into "list" form. >
    :%s/\t\/\^/\t/g
    :%s/\$\/;"//g
    :%s/^/\\ ["/g
    :%s/\t/","/g
    :%s/$/"],
<
Be very careful about the double-quotes. If there are ANY double-quotes within
any of the strings, there will be a problem. If you have trouble escaping the
double-quotes, just wipe out the string and replace with something like 
*** See path/to/xyz.module *** to let the user know where to look.

After you have your nicely formatted tags, you can use the list items in the
plugin. Note that the list will not be automatically sorted for various
reasons. Keep the tags in order if you modify the tags list within the
plugin.
