OVERVIEW                                                *drupal6complete-intro*

This document explains the basics of the drupal6complete script. The script 
will add omnicompletion for the Drupal 6 API through the use of 
auto-generated ctags.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                   *drupal6complete-usage*

The following should be added to your .vimrc file to trigger the plugin:
>
    imap <buffer> <C-d> <C-\><C-O>:call drupal6complete#Map()<CR><C-X><C-O>
<
By default (shown above) you hit "Ctrl-d" to autocomplete. So, for example,
I can type "drupal_get_" followed by "Ctrl-d" and I'll be presented with any
matches.

The <C-d> can be changed to whatever trigger you would like. <C-C>d, for 
example, would trigger the completion on "Ctrl-c", immediately followed by 
hitting 'd'.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION           *drupal6complete-configuration* *drupal6complete-ctags*

This script doesn't require or offer too many configuration options (at the
time of writing).

Automatic Parenthesis~
Function suggestions can have a ( automatically applied by setting the
following variable in your .vimrc file: >
    let g:drupal6complete_add_paren = 1
<
Completion Results~
By default, omni completion doesn't show the menu if only one result is found.
The following setting will show the menu even when there is only one match: >
    set cot+=menuone
<

DEVELOPER INFORMATION                              *drupal6complete-developers*

The following information is for developers, and attempts to explain how the
datasource for the drupal6complete is created.

You will need a current version of Exuberant ctags to use all of the options 
required. You can obtain the latest version here: http://ctags.sourceforge.net

You can feed ctags specific files and directories, and it will automatically 
create a tags file. This file will require some cleanup before you can use
it for the plugin. You will want to run a command like below from the root of 
a Drupal installation. You can feed ctags more directories and files than
the ones in this example.

Simple example (Drupal core only) >
    ctags --php-kinds=-v --langmap=php:.module.inc -R 
    \ includes/* modules/* themes/engines/* 
<
Advanced example (Drupal core with a specific few modules) >
    ctags --php-kinds=-v --langmap=php:.module.inc -R 
    \ includes/* modules/* themes/engines/* sites/all/modules/views/*
    \ sites/all/themes/zen/*
<

After running the ctags command and checking the resulting file for 
double-quotes (and replacing them with single quotes), these commands will 
clean up the tags, and put them into "list" form. >
    :%s/\t\/\^/\t/g
    :%s/\$\/;"//g
    :%s/^/\\ ["/g
    :%s/\t/","/g
    :%s/$/"],
<
Be very careful about the double-quotes. If there are ANY double quotes within
any of the strings, there will be a problem. On occasion, you may not be able
to replace the double-quotes with singles. If this is the case, just wipe out
the string and replace with something like "*** SEE includes/xyz.module *** to
let the user know where to look. This has only happened on 2 occasions in the
core Drupal6 list that is the default for this module.

After you have your nicely formatted tags, you can use the list items in the
plugin. Note that the list will not be automatically sorted for various
reasons. Try to keep your tags in order if you modify the tags list within the
plugin.
